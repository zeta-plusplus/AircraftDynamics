	<h3>AircraftDyamics </h3>
		<p>
		Library for estimation of performance of airfoil, wing, and aircraft, and dynamic simulation of 2D/3D.
		</p>
		<p>
		Interfaces and Media in components in this library are compatibile those of Modelica Standard Library. If not, interfaces are provided with real in/out connectors or expandable connector Please do not hesitate to build system model combining components in this library and those of Modelca Standard Library.
		</p>
		<p>
		Please refer to "Examples" package first so as to learn how to use this library. There are demo and test models.
		</p>
		<p> &emsp; </p>
		
	<h4>&emsp;|__ AeroDynamics </h4>
		<p>
		contains components and base codes for calculations of wing/airfoil characteristics and performance. Ex. 2d airfoil calculating Cl and Cd from given incoming airflow and Cl curve data.
		</p>
	
	<h4>&emsp;|__ PtMassFDM </h4>
		<p>
		contains components and base equation codes for 2D/3D point mass flight dynamics simulation. Ex, pont mass which calculates velocities, positions, and attitude of the aircraft in future with given lift, drag, thrust, and gravity.
		</p>
	
	<h4>&emsp;|__ RigidBodyFDM </h4>
		<p>
		contains components and base equation codes for 3D rigid body flight dynamics simulation. Ex, the wing which calculates 3D forces and moments exerted on wing root.
