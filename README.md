# AircraftDynamics

## License
All library source cords and example models are licensed with GPL v3.

## Purpose & Usage
This is the library for aerodynamics/flight-dynamics simulation of aircrafts.  
Various levels of modeling methodologies are covered, from very basic such as 2d airfoil with linear approximation, to 3Dof-point-mass/6Dof-rigid-body motion simulation of fully assembled aircraft model.  
* 6Dof-rigid-body simulation components are not build yet, planned so far.

## Documentation
link to top-page of documentation (notice under development):  
https://zeta-plusplus.github.io/AircraftDynamics/

Please also refer to example models in "Examples" package.

## Responsibility
Anybody can use components and example models without any charge for any purpose as long as GPL v3 is not violated. However, please use them with your own responsibility. The autheor cannot take any responsibilty for result of calculation of components and example models.

## Causion
### dependency
Many of models packed in this library depend on following libraries. Please download/clone and load it too.  
 -. PropulsionSystem (by same author): https://github.com/zeta-plusplus/PropulsionSystem  
 -. FluidSystemComponents(by same author): https://github.com/zeta-plusplus/FluidSystemComponents  

### under very active development
many source codes are modified and old unorganized codes are deleted very often. Be causious if you use by cloning the repository. Download of branch named with "stable_" is recommended.
